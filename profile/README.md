# Next-Gen Emissions Inventory expansion of Akagi (NEIVA)

### Welcome to NEIVA!

NEIVA is a biomass burning emissions inventory in which emission factors (EFs) for over 1500 constituents have been integrated and organized by 14 globally-relevant fuel and fire types. NEIVA builds on the 2011 EF compilation of [Akagi et al.](https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-11-4039-2011), adding published data from recent laboratory and field studies. NEIVA has been structured to allow easy integration of new data and flexible querying based on user needs. NEIVA consists of a series of datasets that are linked using unique identifiers. All of the gaseous compounds have been mapped to model surrogates for widely-used chemical mechanisms to facilitate use of these data in air quality and climate modeling applications. EFs can be queried at the individual compound/fuel/study level to pollutant category/model surrogate/global fire type level. This GitHub repository includes data files and database design codes for data integration, processing, and querying.
